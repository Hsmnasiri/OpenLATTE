The chain begins with a call using the hardcoded integer constant 3, eliminating any possibility of user-controlled input causing an integer overflow. This safe, constant value is then passed to a printf function that uses a static format string, which is also secure. The various type casts performed on the constant are benign and do not alter the value in a dangerous way.
