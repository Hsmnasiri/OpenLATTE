{"vulnerability": "CWE190_Integer_Overflow__char_fscanf_preinc_05", "functional_semantics": "These functions read a single character byte from standard input into a local variable. They then increment the value of this character by one and pass the result to a subsequent function for further processing.", "vulnerability_cause": "The vulnerability is a signed integer overflow. The vulnerable code increments a signed character variable (`local_12`) without first checking if its value is at the maximum limit (127, or `0x7f`). If a user supplies an input of 127, the operation `local_12 + '\\x01'` overflows, wrapping the value around to -128. This unintended sign flip from a large positive number to a large negative number is passed to `FUN_0010186b`, which could lead to unexpected behavior or further exploitation.", "fixing_solution": "The patch mitigates the vulnerability by introducing a boundary check before the arithmetic operation. The patched code explicitly checks if `local_12` is equal to `\\x7f` (127). If the check is true, it aborts the operation and reports an error, thus preventing the integer overflow. The potentially dangerous increment is only performed if the input value is safely below the maximum limit.", "bad_code": "\nvoid FUN_001013c9(void)\n\n{\n  long in_FS_OFFSET;\n  char local_12;\n  char local_11;\n  long local_10;\n  \n  local_10 = *(long *)(in_FS_OFFSET + 0x28);\n  local_12 = ' ';\n  if (DAT_00104010 != 0) {\n    __isoc99_fscanf(stdin,&DAT_00102008,&local_12);\n  }\n  if (DAT_00104010 != 0) {\n    local_12 = local_12 + '\\x01';\n    local_11 = local_12;\n    FUN_0010186b((int)local_12);\n  }\n  if (local_10 != *(long *)(in_FS_OFFSET + 0x28)) {\n                    /* WARNING: Subroutine does not return */\n    __stack_chk_fail();\n  }\n  return;\n}\n\n", "good_code": "\nvoid FUN_00101451(void)\n\n{\n  long in_FS_OFFSET;\n  char local_12;\n  char local_11;\n  long local_10;\n  \n  local_10 = *(long *)(in_FS_OFFSET + 0x28);\n  local_12 = ' ';\n  if (DAT_00104010 != 0) {\n    __isoc99_fscanf(stdin,&DAT_00102008,&local_12);\n  }\n  if (DAT_0010402c == 0) {\n    if (local_12 == '\\x7f') {\n      FUN_001016f1(\"data value is too large to perform arithmetic safely.\");\n    }\n    else {\n      local_12 = local_12 + '\\x01';\n      local_11 = local_12;\n      FUN_0010186b((int)local_12);\n    }\n  }\n  else {\n    FUN_001016f1(\"Benign, fixed string\");\n  }\n  if (local_10 != *(long *)(in_FS_OFFSET + 0x28)) {\n                    /* WARNING: Subroutine does not return */\n    __stack_chk_fail();\n  }\n  return;\n}\n\n"}
