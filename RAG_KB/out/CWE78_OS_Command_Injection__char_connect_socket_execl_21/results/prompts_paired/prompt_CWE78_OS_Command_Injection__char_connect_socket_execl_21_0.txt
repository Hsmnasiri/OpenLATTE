You are an expert security analyst. I will provide you with a pair of decompiled C functions: one is vulnerable, and the other is the patched, non-vulnerable version. Your task is to analyze both and provide a structured analysis in JSON format.

Here is the vulnerable code:
```c

void FUN_0010166c(void)

{
  undefined8 uVar1;
  long in_FS_OFFSET;
  undefined8 local_78;
  undefined8 local_70;
  undefined8 local_68;
  undefined8 local_60;
  undefined8 local_58;
  undefined8 local_50;
  undefined8 local_48;
  undefined8 local_40;
  undefined8 local_38;
  undefined8 local_30;
  undefined8 local_28;
  undefined8 local_20;
  undefined4 local_18;
  long local_10;
  
  local_10 = *(long *)(in_FS_OFFSET + 0x28);
  local_78 = 0x20736c;
  local_70 = 0;
  local_68 = 0;
  local_60 = 0;
  local_58 = 0;
  local_50 = 0;
  local_48 = 0;
  local_40 = 0;
  local_38 = 0;
  local_30 = 0;
  local_28 = 0;
  local_20 = 0;
  local_18 = 0;
  DAT_0010501c = 1;
  uVar1 = FUN_001014e9(&local_78);
  execl("/bin/sh","/bin/sh",&DAT_0010300e,uVar1,0);
  if (local_10 != *(long *)(in_FS_OFFSET + 0x28)) {
                    /* WARNING: Subroutine does not return */
    __stack_chk_fail();
  }
  return;
}


```

Here is the patched (non-vulnerable) code:
```c

void FUN_001017a9(void)

{
  undefined8 uVar1;
  long in_FS_OFFSET;
  undefined8 local_78;
  undefined8 local_70;
  undefined8 local_68;
  undefined8 local_60;
  undefined8 local_58;
  undefined8 local_50;
  undefined8 local_48;
  undefined8 local_40;
  undefined8 local_38;
  undefined8 local_30;
  undefined8 local_28;
  undefined8 local_20;
  undefined4 local_18;
  long local_10;
  
  local_10 = *(long *)(in_FS_OFFSET + 0x28);
  local_78 = 0x20736c;
  local_70 = 0;
  local_68 = 0;
  local_60 = 0;
  local_58 = 0;
  local_50 = 0;
  local_48 = 0;
  local_40 = 0;
  local_38 = 0;
  local_30 = 0;
  local_28 = 0;
  local_20 = 0;
  local_18 = 0;
  DAT_00105020 = 0;
  uVar1 = FUN_0010175c(&local_78);
  execl("/bin/sh","/bin/sh",&DAT_0010300e,uVar1,0);
  if (local_10 != *(long *)(in_FS_OFFSET + 0x28)) {
                    /* WARNING: Subroutine does not return */
    __stack_chk_fail();
  }
  return;
}


```

Please provide your analysis in the following JSON format. Do not include any other text or explanations outside of the JSON block.

```json
{
  "functional_semantics": "Describe the shared purpose of these two functions in 1-2 sentences. What are they supposed to do?",
  "vulnerability_cause": "Based on the differences between the vulnerable and patched code, explain the root cause of the vulnerability. Be specific about what is missing or incorrect in the vulnerable version.",
  "fixing_solution": "Describe the patch. Explain exactly how the changes in the patched code mitigate the vulnerability."
}
```
